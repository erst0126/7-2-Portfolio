CS-230 Class Portfolio

In CS-230, Software Development Lifecycle, we learned about Agile and Waterfall project management styles. We learned when it would be best to use one over the other, the principles of each, and how they are similar/different. We worked mostly with agile project management methods, where we were tasked with taking on each role of the Scrum Team and performing their tasks.
