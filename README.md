-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

First, the Product Owner has to meet with the client and a group of users. They discuss the clients requirements, and then the user needs help to iron out the specifics of the clients requirements. To interpret the user needs, I created user stories. Each user story consisted of one requirement at a time, with a list of the specific things the requirement should have to make sure it functions properly and meets the needs of the users. 

-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

After taking this class, I can see how Agile and Waterfall are both useful when it comes to program development. Personally, I prefer the Agile approach, since it is more flexible and is always prepared for any changes in requirements. I think that being able to incorporate the flexibility is extrememly important, and working on the SNHU Travel project during this class confirmed that when the requirments changed. Since we were using an agile approcach, the change did not effect deadlines or realease dates and was al ot less stress on the team since the release plan was already adaptable.

-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member, you have to be open with communication and make sure that you stay up to date on the progress of the final product. Openness is important because if the communication is lacking or the enviornment doesn't make the feel safe enough to express complaints or concerns, then that can cause the whole plan to fall apart.
